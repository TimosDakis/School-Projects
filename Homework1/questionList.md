**Problem 1:** Design a vector and a linked list with necessary functions and compare insertion of different element.

**Problem 2:** Implement and compare recursive, iterative, and linked-list-based binary searches on cases of 1 million random numbers and 10 million random numbers

**Problem 3:** Design a bubble, insertion, and selection sort for nxn 2D matrices that do not force them into 1D arrays

**Problem 4:** Implement a bubble sort and insertion sort for 1D arrays and linked lists

**Problem 5:** Create a multilevel sort and compare it to two other sorts

**Problem 6:** Compare a similar operation on a large scale between three standard c++ containers

**Problem 8:** Design a templated class that generates random numbers and then finds all the subsets that add up to a provided sum

**Problem 9:** Create a structure fills with 0s and 1s of size t, check if it is a deBruijn sequence of B(2, k), where t = 2k, and if not mutate each element at a 5% chance. Time it 100 times total

**Problem 10:** Make a sort that puts all odd numbers first and even numbers after

**Problem 11:** Create a Restaurant superclass, and 3 child classes which are specific types Restaurants, then create a templated robot which reads the menu of these

**Problem 12:** Design a doubly linked list and implement insertion and deletion, where insertion inputs appointments at the correct time, and if not possible the closest free time that works

**Problem 13:** Make a function that fills two doubly linked lists, one with workers and the other with their jobs, then show how to shift the job list backward when needed (so worker 4 gets job 3, etc., after first shift back)
